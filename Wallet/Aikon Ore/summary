ORE ID is a single sign-on identification platform that works cross-chain.
With ORE ID, users of your web or mobile app easily create an on-chain account upon first sign-in. Their private key is encrypted with a PIN of their choosing and stored for them so your users never have to remember their blockchain accounts or keys.
ORE ID removes the friction between your app and your future users.
