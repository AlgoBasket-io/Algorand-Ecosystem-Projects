xBacked is building a decentralized, permissionless stablecoin on Algorand, fully backed by crypto assets instead of centralized assets. No central entity controls the issuance of xUSD and other tokens the xBacked protocol might build in the future.
The xBacked protocol brings a stable, decentralized, form of exchange to the ecosystem.
